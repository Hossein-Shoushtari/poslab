## short intro
### Python files
main.py = website is build | server is established | functions are called
**_layout.py = layout of tabs | no funcionality
**_func.py = functions of tabs  -> this would be the space to add new functions; I will do the correct connecting to the buttons
### assets
Floorplans = the original floorplans | no further need; already converted
floorplans_converted = all converted and usable flooplans/maps | these will be displayed on the map
### HTML file
index.html = automatically created with folium to get the map as an Iframe with dash
### for heroku deploy
- .gitignore
